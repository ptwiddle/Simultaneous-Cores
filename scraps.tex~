%First, recall that the parts $\lambda_i$ of $\lambda=\core_a(\mathbf{c})$ correspond to electrons with energy larger than the lowest unoccupied state.  The class of $\lambda_i-i\mod a$ is exactly which runner the electron appears on; hence, the cells in the $a$-part of $\core_a(\mathbf{c})$ are exactly those cells whose occupied state corresponds to the highest energy electron on a runner.

%How many cells are in the $i$-row?
\subsubsection{Chambers of linearity} It is clear from the definitions that $\sk_{i,j}$ and $\sk_{i,j}^b$, and hence $\sk$ and $\sk^b$, are piecewise linear functions of $\mathbf{c}$.  We now examine chamber structure and dependence of these functions.


Recall that the chambers of the $A_a$ arrangement are labeled by permutations $\sigma\in S_a$ that determine the ordering of the $\mathbf{c}_i$.  More explicitly, $\mathbf{c}$ is in the interior of chamber $\sigma$ if and only if $c_{\sigma(0)}<c_{\sigma(1)}<\cdots<c_{\sigma_{a-1}}$.

Recall that for $\sigma\in S_a$, the number of \emph{inversions} of $\sigma$ is $$\inv(\sigma)=\#\{(i,j)|0\leq i<j\leq (a-1), \sigma(i)>\sigma(j)\}$$.

Then for $\mathbf{c}$ in the interior of chamber $\sigma$, we have
\begin{align*}
\sk(\mathbf{c})&= \sum_{i,j=0}^{a-1}  \max(c_j-c_i-\delta_{j<i}, 0) \\
 &=\sum_{0\leq i<j\leq a-1} (c_{\sigma(j)}-c_{\sigma(i)}-\delta_{\sigma(j)<\sigma(i)}) \\
                &=-\inv(\sigma)+\sum_{i=0}^{a-1}(1-a+2i)c_{\sigma(i)}\\
&=-\inv(\sigma)+2a\langle\mathbf{s},\sigma(\mathbf{c}\rangle
\end{align*}

Where the second equality follows because $i$ is greater than $i$ elements in $\{0,1,\dots,a-1\}$ and less than $(a-1-i)$ elements, and thus $c_{\sigma_i}$ appears with a positive sign $i$ times in $\sum c_{\sigma(j)}-c_{\sigma(i)}$ times and a negative sign $(a-1-i)$ times.



\begin{lemma}
In terms of the $x$-coordinates, we would expect this to be closely related to $\sum_{i<j}|x_i-x_j|$.

If $\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{C}_\sigma$, we compute
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i<j} |x_i-x_j|&=\sum_{i<j} x_{\sigma(j)}-x_{\sigma(i)}\\
&=\sum_{i<j} c_{\sigma(j)}-c_{\sigma(i)}+\sum_{i<j}s_{\sigma(j)}-s_{\sigma(i)} \end{align*}

The second term depends only on the partition $\sigma$.

\begin{definition}[\cite{SU}] Let $$\INV(\sigma)=\{(i,j)|i<j,\sigma(i)>\sigma(j)\}$$ be the set of inversions of $\sigma$.

Define the \emph{inversion sum} of $\invsum(\sigma)$ to be
$$\invsum(\sigma)=\sum_{(i,j)\in\INV(\sigma)}
\sigma(j)-\sigma(i)=\sum_{(i,j)\in\INV(\sigma)} (j-i)$$
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
That the two definitions of $\invsum(\sigma)$ are equal is Proposition 2.4 in \cite{SU}.

This statistic is also on \url{http://www.findstat.org/} , in an
unconnected manner, with the following description: the permutation
matrix of $\sigma$ is also an alternating sign matrix (or ASM for
short), which form a lattice.  The lattice of ASM is in some well
defined sense the smallest lattice extending the Bruhat order.  The
statistic $\invsum(\sigma)$ is the rank of $\sigma$ in the lattice of
ASMs.  See \cite{}
\end{remark}

With this definition, we have
\begin{align*}\sum_{i<j}s_{\sigma(j)}-s_{\sigma(i)} &=\frac{1}{s}\sum_{i<j}\sigma(j)-\sigma(i)\\
&=\frac{1}{s}\frac{(s-1)s(2s-1)}{6}-\frac{2}{s}\invsum(\sigma)
\end{align*}
The first term in the second line is the sum of the first $(s-1)$
squares, which



Thus, we are lead to consider the sum of all inversions of $\sigma$.
This statistic has appeared before, \cite{SU} introduce this stati






Which leads us naturally to the partition statistic $i\sigma(i)$.  As written, this depends on the normalization of whether our group permute $\{0,\dots,a-1\}$ or $\{0,\dots,a\}$.  In any case, the sum is clearly at a maximum on the identity,  where it is the sum of squares.  It is more natural to have partition statistics be zero on the identity, and so we are lead to define the partition statistic:

$$\asm(\sigma)=\frac{(a-1)a(2a-3)}{6}-\sum_{i=0}^{a-1}i\sigma(i)$$




$$\sum_{i=0}^{a-1} (1-2a+2i)\frac{\sigma(i)}{a}=\frac{1-2a}{a}\sum\sigma(i)+2\sum_{i=0}^{a-1}i\sigma(i)$$

The first term is independent of $\sigma$ and is equal to $(1-2a)(1-a)/2$; the second term, over
